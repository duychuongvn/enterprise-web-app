As a Java developer, I was responsible for building many full lifecycle web applications based Spring Framework, 
from initialize a new project to deploy onto production. 
During this time, I learned what we should do to build a success project with Spring Framework that developers can join, 
easy scalable, maintainable and faster. 
This project is a template and provides common utilities that can be customized for specific project.
Developer can use it to build your own company or shool project base on this without license required
